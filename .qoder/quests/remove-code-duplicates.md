# Code Duplication and Unused Import Removal Design

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the design for removing code duplication and unused imports in the Phantom Fragment project. The issues identified include:

1. Unused imports in `internal/security/audit/audit_system_v3.go`
2. Unused imports and broken dependencies in `internal/security/profiles/advanced_profiles_v3.go`
3. Code duplication between `internal/supervisor/service.go` and `internal/supervisor/service_clean.go`

## 2. Problem Analysis

### 2.1 Unused Imports in Audit System

The file `internal/security/audit/audit_system_v3.go` contains several unused imports:
- `encoding/json`
- `os`
- `path/filepath`
- `github.com/phantom-fragment/phantom-fragment/internal/security`

### 2.2 Issues in Advanced Profiles

The file `internal/security/profiles/advanced_profiles_v3.go` has multiple issues:
- Unused imports: `encoding/json`, `os`, `strings`, `golang.org/x/sys/unix`
- Broken import: `github.com/phantom-fragment/phantom-fragment/internal/security/bpf`
- Undefined references to `capabilities.CapabilityManager`, `capabilities.CapabilityEnforcer`, etc.

### 2.3 Code Duplication in Supervisor Service

There is complete duplication of code between:
- `internal/supervisor/service.go`
- `internal/supervisor/service_clean.go`

Both files define identical types and functions:
- `RateLimiter` interface
- `SimpleRateLimiter` struct
- `NewSimpleRateLimiter` function
- `Service` struct
- `Metrics` struct
- `HealthChecker` struct
- `HealthCheck` struct
- `NewService` function
- And several other functions

## 3. Solution Design

### 3.1 Remove Unused Imports

For `internal/security/audit/audit_system_v3.go`:
- Remove `encoding/json` import
- Remove `os` import
- Remove `path/filepath` import
- Remove `github.com/phantom-fragment/phantom-fragment/internal/security` import

For `internal/security/profiles/advanced_profiles_v3.go`:
- Remove `encoding/json` import
- Remove `os` import
- Remove `strings` import
- Remove `golang.org/x/sys/unix` import
- Fix or remove broken `github.com/phantom-fragment/phantom-fragment/internal/security/bpf` import
- Resolve undefined references to capabilities package

### 3.2 Resolve Code Duplication

Consolidate the supervisor service implementation:
- Keep only one implementation of the supervisor service
- Remove `internal/supervisor/service_clean.go` as it appears to be a duplicate of `internal/supervisor/service.go`
- Ensure all functionality is preserved in the remaining file

## 4. Implementation Plan

### 4.1 Phase 1: Address Unused Imports

1. Edit `internal/security/audit/audit_system_v3.go`:
   - Remove unused import statements (`encoding/json`, `os`, `path/filepath`, `github.com/phantom-fragment/phantom-fragment/internal/security`)
   - Verify that the code still compiles and functions correctly
   - Check that no functionality is broken after removing the imports

2. Edit `internal/security/profiles/advanced_profiles_v3.go`:
   - Remove unused import statements
   - Investigate and fix the broken bpf import
   - Resolve undefined references to capabilities package

### 4.2 Phase 2: Resolve Code Duplication

1. Compare `internal/supervisor/service.go` and `internal/supervisor/service_clean.go` to confirm they are duplicates
2. Remove `internal/supervisor/service_clean.go` as it appears to be redundant
3. Verify that the supervisor service still functions correctly with only one implementation file

## 5. Risk Assessment

### 5.1 Low Risk
- Removing unused imports has minimal risk as they are not being used
- Compilation will fail if there are any false positives

### 5.2 Medium Risk
- Resolving broken dependencies in advanced profiles requires careful analysis
- Need to ensure that removing the bpf import doesn't break intended functionality

### 5.3 High Risk
- Consolidating supervisor service files requires careful analysis to ensure no functionality is lost
- Need to verify all references are correctly updated

## 6. Testing Strategy

### 6.1 Unit Testing
- Verify that all existing unit tests pass after changes
- Add new tests if functionality is modified

### 6.2 Integration Testing
- Test supervisor service functionality with the consolidated implementation
- Verify security profile loading and application

### 6.3 Regression Testing
- Run full test suite to ensure no regressions are introduced
- Validate that all CLI commands still function correctly
