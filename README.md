### Implications of the Modular Fragment System

The modular fragment system represents a paradigm shift from monolithic containers to dynamic, task-specific composition:

**Key Implications:**

- **True Modularity**: Components loaded only when needed, eliminating bloat
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Base 3MB core fragment scales to 18MB based on actual requirements
- **Intelligent Composition**: Task Analyzer decomposes workloads to determine required capabilities
- **Parallel Loading**: Component Loader supports concurrent component loading for performance
- **Memory Efficiency**: Unused components automatically cleaned up after 5 minutes

**Architectural Benefits:**

- Eliminates the "all-or-nothing" approach of traditional containers
- Enables fine-grained resource allocation based on actual task needs
- Supports intelligent caching of frequently used component combinations
### How Component Loader and Task Analyzer Work

**Component Loader:**

- Manages loading of individual system components (TCP stack, DNS resolver, socket API, etc.)
- Supports parallel loading with configurable concurrency limits
- Tracks load statistics including memory usage and performance metrics
- Implements caching for frequently used components
- Provides atomic loading with rollback on failure

**Task Analyzer:**

- Performs intelligent task decomposition to identify required capabilities
- Analyzes command arguments, environment variables, and file access patterns
- Determines optimal component set for each task (e.g., network tasks get TCP+DNS+Socket)
- Supports capability-based composition rather than fixed profiles
- Integrates with Fragment Composer for dynamic assembly
### Security Enhancements Mentioned

The security enhancements focus on zero-overhead, kernel-level protection:

**BPF-LSM Integration:**

- Kernel-level access control with pre-compiled BPF programs
- Fast-path optimization for common operations
- Support for multiple LSM hooks (file_open, socket_create, task_alloc, etc.)
- AOT compilation of security policies to BPF bytecode

**Landlock Integration:**

- Unprivileged filesystem access control
- Pre-compiled rulesets cached by profile
- Atomic application to processes with <1ms overhead
- Support for read-only, read-write, and execute access patterns

**AOT Policy Compilation:**

- YAML policies compiled to optimized kernel bytecode
- <50ms compilation time for complex policies
- Zero runtime overhead through pre-compilation
- Support for seccomp, Landlock, and BPF-LSM rules

**Additional Features:**

### Smallest/Largest Phantom Fragment and OS Capability

**Size Specifications:**

- **Smallest Phantom**: 3MB core fragment providing essential process execution (spawning, security basics, runtime environment)
- **Largest Fragment**: 18MB with all components loaded (core + TCP stack + DNS + Socket API + Init system + Service manager + Device manager + Process management components)

**Scaling Examples:**

- Simple tasks (echo, scripts): 3MB core only
- DNS resolution: 4MB (core + DNS resolver)
- Network applications: 7MB (core + TCP + DNS + Socket)
- System administration: 9MB (core + Init system)
- Full OS operations: 18MB (all components)

**OS Capability:**

Yes, Phantom Fragment can run OS-level processes. As a container alternative, it provides:

- Full process lifecycle management
- System call filtering via seccomp
- Namespace isolation (user, pid, mount, network, etc.)
- Capability management and dropping
- Filesystem access control via Landlock
- Network stack with full TCP/IP support
- Device access and hardware interaction
- Service management and init system capabilities

It supports running complete operating system environments while maintaining the lightweight, modular architecture that enables dynamic component loading based on actual task requirements.

- Security at line rate with <5ms policy application
- Real-time audit logging and violation detection
- Multi-level security (Minimal/Medium/Maximum) with adaptive switching
- Integration with AppArmor/SELinux for comprehensive coverage


Together they enable the system to compose exactly the right components for each task, minimizing resource usage while maintaining functionality.

- Provides foundation for adaptive execution that can upgrade/downgrade security modes


### **Quick Install (Recommended)**

```bash
# Download the latest release for Linux
wget https://github.com/phantom-fragment/releases/latest/phantom-fragment-linux.tar.gz

# Extract the archive
tar xzf phantom-fragment-linux.tar.gz

# Navigate into the project directory
cd phantom-fragment
```

### **Important: Directory Usage**

**ALL COMMANDS MUST BE RUN FROM THE PROJECT DIRECTORY.**

Phantom Fragment is designed with an optimized directory structure. To ensure all components work correctly, always run commands from within the `phantom-fragment` directory.

```powershell
# ❌ WRONG (running from a parent directory):
PS C:\path\to\parent> phantom-fragment\bin\phantom.exe --help
# This will likely fail to find necessary resources.

# ✅ CORRECT (navigate to the project directory first):
PS C:\path\to\parent> cd phantom-fragment
PS C:\path\to\parent\phantom-fragment> .\bin\phantom.exe --help
# This will work as expected.
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

This example demonstrates how to run a simple Python script inside a secure Phantom Fragment sandbox.

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd phantom-fragment

# Execute a one-line Python script and measure the startup time
time ./bin/phantom run --profile python-dev python -c "import sys; print(f'Python {sys.version} in {sys.platform} fragment')"

# For comparison, run the same command with Docker
time docker run --rm python:3.11-alpine python -c "import sys; print(f'Python {sys.version} in {sys.platform} container')"
```
You should observe that Phantom Fragment completes the task in a fraction of the time it takes Docker, typically 4-6 times faster.

## 💻 Usage

### **For Human Developers (CLI)**

The `phantom` CLI is your primary tool for interacting with fragments. It's designed to be fast, intuitive, and powerful.

```bash
# Run a command in a sandboxed environment with a specific profile
# The 'python-dev' profile provides a secure environment for Python development
./bin/phantom run --profile python-dev python your_script.py

# Create a persistent workspace for a project
# This creates a 'zygote' (a pre-warmed instance) for ultra-fast access
./bin/phantom create --name my-project --profile go-dev --mode direct

# List all available security and performance profiles
./bin/phantom profile list --benchmark

# Monitor the real-time performance of a running fragment
./bin/phantom monitor my-project --metrics

# Properly shut down and clean up a fragment and its resources
./bin/phantom destroy my-project
```

### **For LLM Agents (MCP Integration)**

Phantom Fragment can be integrated with LLM agents like Claude, GPT, or Gemini via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), providing them with a secure, high-performance execution environment.

**1. Start the MCP Server**

The MCP server acts as a bridge between the LLM agent and Phantom Fragment.

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd phantom-fragment

# Start the MCP server in stdio mode with pre-warmed zygotes for the fastest response
# This is ideal for desktop agents or tools that can communicate over stdin/stdout
./bin/phantom-mcp --transport stdio --mode zygote --profiles python,node,go

# Alternatively, start an HTTP server for web-based LLMs or services
# This uses io_uring for high-performance networking on Linux
./bin/phantom-mcp --transport http --port 8080 --io-mode uring
```

**2. Configure Your LLM Agent**

You'll need to configure your agent to use the MCP server. Here is an example for a hypothetical desktop agent:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "phantom-fragment": {
      "command": "C:\\path\\to\\phantom-fragment\\bin\\phantom-mcp.exe",
      "args": ["--transport", "stdio", "--mode", "zygote", "--profiles", "python,node,go"],
      "env": {
        "PHANTOM_PERFORMANCE_MODE": "maximum",
        "PHANTOM_ZYGOTE_POOL_SIZE": "3"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Once configured, your LLM agent can execute code, manage files, and perform other tasks within the secure confines of Phantom Fragment, with near-native performance.

## 🧪 Testing

This project includes several scripts to test functionality, performance, and integrations.

### **Performance & Integration Tests**

These scripts run a comprehensive suite of tests to benchmark performance and validate key features.

-   `test-phantom-performance.sh` (for Linux/macOS)
-   `test-phantom-performance.ps1` (for Windows)

**Usage:**
```bash
# On Linux or macOS
./test-phantom-performance.sh

# On Windows (you may need to adjust your execution policy)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./test-phantom-performance.ps1
```
These tests will benchmark core operations like startup time, I/O throughput, and memory usage, and compare them against Docker if it is installed.

### **MCP Protocol Tests**

This script specifically tests the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to ensure it's functioning correctly and measures its responsiveness.

-   `test-mcp-basic.sh`

**Usage:**
```bash
# This script tests the basic functionality of the MCP server
./test-mcp-basic.sh
```

### **Fragment-Specific Benchmarks**

This script allows you to run performance tests on specific fragments to measure their individual performance.

-   `test-fragments-benchmark.sh`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run benchmarks on all fragments with 100 iterations each
./test-fragments-benchmark.sh --fragment all --iterations 100

# Run a benchmark specifically on the 'zygote' fragment
./test-fragments-benchmark.sh --fragment zygote
```

## 🛠️ How it Works

Phantom Fragment avoids the overhead of traditional virtualization and containerization by using a set of specialized, high-performance components called "fragments."

### **Fragment Architecture**

Instead of a monolithic daemon, Phantom Fragment is composed of independent yet cooperative fragments, each optimized for a specific task.

**Key Advantages over Docker:**

-   **Zygote Spawning**: We use pre-warmed process templates (`clone3()`) instead of starting a new container from scratch every time. This is a primary reason for our sub-100ms startup times.
-   **Direct Rootfs**: We use a simple, direct filesystem layout, avoiding the performance penalty of Docker's layered filesystem (like overlay2).
-   **Kernel-Native Integration**: We leverage advanced Linux kernel features like BPF, seccomp, and io_uring directly for maximum performance and security.
-   **Self-Contained Binary**: The entire system is distributed as a single, ~50MB binary with an embedded Alpine Linux rootfs, making it portable and easy to deploy.

## 🔒 Security-by-Design

Security is not an afterthought in Phantom Fragment; it is a core design principle with zero performance overhead.

### **Isolation Technologies**

We use a multi-layered security approach to isolate sandboxed environments:

-   **User Namespaces**: Ensures that processes inside the sandbox run as unprivileged users on the host system.
-   **Seccomp Profiles**: We use strict system call filtering to restrict what a sandboxed process can do. Profiles are tailored for each language (e.g., Python, Node.js) to minimize the attack surface.
-   **Capabilities Control**: We drop all unnecessary Linux capabilities, following the principle of least privilege.
-   **Read-only Filesystem**: The base rootfs is immutable, preventing any modification of the core environment.
-   **Network Isolation**: Network access is disabled by default and can be enabled with strict eBPF/XDP-based rules.
-   **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and disk usage are constrained using cgroups.

### **Security Profiles**

Phantom Fragment comes with pre-configured security profiles for common use cases. You can see the full list by running `./bin/phantom profile list`.

| Profile | Language | Network | Filesystem | Use Case |
|---------|----------|---------|------------|-----------|
| `python-dev` | Python | Limited | Restricted | Secure Python development |
| `node-dev` | Node.js | Limited | Restricted | Secure JavaScript/Node development |
| `strict` | Any | Disabled | Read-only | For maximum security applications |

## 🎯 Use Cases

-   **AI Agent Development**: Provide a safe and fast execution environment for code generated by LLMs.
-   **Educational Environments**: Allow students to run code in a secure, isolated sandbox.
-   **CI/CD Integration**: Run build and test jobs in clean, fast, and disposable environments.
-   **Malware Analysis**: Safely analyze suspicious code without risking system integrity.

## 🔧 Building from Source

If you want to build Phantom Fragment from source, you will need Go 1.21+ and Git.

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd phantom-fragment

# Build all components with performance optimizations
# The -ldflags="-s -w" strips debug information, making the binary smaller
# The -tags="netgo,osusergo,static" creates a statically linked binary
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -tags="netgo,osusergo,static" -o bin/phantom ./cmd/phantom
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -tags="netgo,osusergo,static" -o bin/phantom-mcp ./cmd/phantom-mcp
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -tags="netgo,osusergo,static" -o bin/phantom-supervisor ./cmd/phantom-supervisor
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

You can customize Phantom Fragment's behavior through a `config.yaml` file or environment variables.

### **Profile Configuration Example**

Here is an example of how to define a custom profile in your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
profiles:
  my-custom-profile:
    name: "my-custom-profile"
    driver: "bwrap"  # The execution driver to use (Bubblewrap on Linux)
    cpu: "1"         # CPU core limit
    memory: "512m"   # Memory limit
    network:
      enabled: false # Disable network access for this profile
    mounts:
      - source: "./workspace" # Mount the local './workspace' directory...
        target: "/workspace"  # ...to '/workspace' inside the sandbox
        mode: "rw"            # with read-write permissions
```

### **Environment Variables**

```bash
# Set the path to your configuration file
export PHANTOM_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/your/config.yaml

# Set the default security profile to use
export PHANTOM_DEFAULT_PROFILE=my-custom-profile

# Enable verbose debug logging
export PHANTOM_DEBUG=true
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **"Command Not Found" Errors**

-   **Error Message**: `bash: ./bin/phantom: No such file or directory` or `The term '.\bin\phantom.exe' is not recognized...`
-   **Cause**: You are likely in the wrong directory.
-   **Solution**: Make sure you have navigated into the `phantom-fragment` project directory before running any commands.

### **Go Module Errors**

-   **Error Message**: `go: go.mod file not found in current directory`
-   **Cause**: You are trying to run a `go build` command from outside the project directory.
