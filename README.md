# Phantom Fragment - Next-Generation Container Alternative for LLM Agents

**Phantom Fragment** is a revolutionary, performance-by-design sandbox environment engineered specifically for LLM agents and AI-assisted development. Unlike normal layered complexity, Phantom Fragment delivers **quite-advantage performance** with kernel-native optimization, sub-100ms startup times, and zero-overhead security.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of Phantom Fragment, from basic installation and usage to advanced topics like performance tuning, security, and testing.

## üöÄ Performance Highlights

Phantom Fragment is designed from the ground up to be significantly faster and lighter than traditional containerization solutions like Docker. This is achieved through a combination of kernel-native features and an architecture optimized for the common workflows of AI agents.

| Metric | Phantom Fragment | Docker | Improvement |
|------------------|------------------|--------|-------------|
| **Cold Start** | 89ms | 387ms | **4.3√ó faster** |
| **Warm Start** | 23ms | 156ms | **6.8√ó faster** |
| **Memory/Container** | 8.4MB | 67MB | **8√ó lighter** |
| **I/O Throughput** | 2.1GB/s | 890MB/s | **2.4√ó faster** |
| **Binary Size** | 47MB | 2.3GB daemon | **49√ó smaller** |

*Benchmarked on Linux 6.5, Intel i7-12700K, 32GB RAM, NVMe SSD*

## üì¶ Installation

### **Quick Install (Recommended)**

```bash
# Download the latest release for Linux
wget https://github.com/phantom-fragment/releases/latest/phantom-fragment-linux.tar.gz

# Extract the archive
tar xzf phantom-fragment-linux.tar.gz

# Navigate into the project directory
cd phantom-fragment
```

### **Important: Directory Usage**

**ALL COMMANDS MUST BE RUN FROM THE PROJECT DIRECTORY.**

Phantom Fragment is designed with an optimized directory structure. To ensure all components work correctly, always run commands from within the `phantom-fragment` directory.

```powershell
# ‚ùå WRONG (running from a parent directory):
PS C:\path\to\parent> phantom-fragment\bin\phantom.exe --help
# This will likely fail to find necessary resources.

# ‚úÖ CORRECT (navigate to the project directory first):
PS C:\path\to\parent> cd phantom-fragment
PS C:\path\to\parent\phantom-fragment> .\bin\phantom.exe --help
# This will work as expected.
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

This example demonstrates how to run a simple Python script inside a secure Phantom Fragment sandbox.

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd phantom-fragment

# Execute a one-line Python script and measure the startup time
time ./bin/phantom run --profile python-dev python -c "import sys; print(f'Python {sys.version} in {sys.platform} fragment')"

# For comparison, run the same command with Docker
time docker run --rm python:3.11-alpine python -c "import sys; print(f'Python {sys.version} in {sys.platform} container')"
```
You should observe that Phantom Fragment completes the task in a fraction of the time it takes Docker, typically 4-6 times faster.

## üíª Usage

### **For Human Developers (CLI)**

The `phantom` CLI is your primary tool for interacting with fragments. It's designed to be fast, intuitive, and powerful.

```bash
# Run a command in a sandboxed environment with a specific profile
# The 'python-dev' profile provides a secure environment for Python development
./bin/phantom run --profile python-dev python your_script.py

# Create a persistent workspace for a project
# This creates a 'zygote' (a pre-warmed instance) for ultra-fast access
./bin/phantom create --name my-ai-project --profile go-dev --mode direct

# List all available security and performance profiles
./bin/phantom profile list --benchmark

# Monitor the real-time performance of a running fragment
./bin/phantom monitor my-ai-project --metrics

# Properly shut down and clean up a fragment and its resources
./bin/phantom destroy my-ai-project
```

### **For LLM Agents (MCP Integration)**

Phantom Fragment can be integrated with LLM agents like Claude, GPT, or Gemini via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), providing them with a secure, high-performance execution environment.

**1. Start the MCP Server**

The MCP server acts as a bridge between the LLM agent and Phantom Fragment.

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd phantom-fragment

# Start the MCP server in stdio mode with pre-warmed zygotes for the fastest response
# This is ideal for desktop agents or tools that can communicate over stdin/stdout
./bin/phantom-mcp --transport stdio --mode zygote --profiles python,node,go

# Alternatively, start an HTTP server for web-based LLMs or services
# This uses io_uring for high-performance networking on Linux
./bin/phantom-mcp --transport http --port 8080 --io-mode uring
```

**2. Configure Your LLM Agent**

You'll need to configure your agent to use the MCP server. Here is an example for a hypothetical desktop agent:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "phantom-fragment": {
      "command": "C:\\path\\to\\phantom-fragment\\bin\\phantom-mcp.exe",
      "args": ["--transport", "stdio", "--mode", "zygote", "--profiles", "python,node,go"],
      "env": {
        "PHANTOM_PERFORMANCE_MODE": "maximum",
        "PHANTOM_ZYGOTE_POOL_SIZE": "3"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Once configured, your LLM agent can execute code, manage files, and perform other tasks within the secure confines of Phantom Fragment, with near-native performance.

## üß™ Testing

This project includes several scripts to test functionality, performance, and integrations.

### **Performance & Integration Tests**

These scripts run a comprehensive suite of tests to benchmark performance and validate key features.

-   `test-phantom-performance.sh` (for Linux/macOS)
-   `test-phantom-performance.ps1` (for Windows)

**Usage:**
```bash
# On Linux or macOS
./test-phantom-performance.sh

# On Windows (you may need to adjust your execution policy)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./test-phantom-performance.ps1
```
These tests will benchmark core operations like startup time, I/O throughput, and memory usage, and compare them against Docker if it is installed.

### **MCP Protocol Tests**

This script specifically tests the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to ensure it's functioning correctly and measures its responsiveness.

-   `test-mcp-basic.sh`

**Usage:**
```bash
# This script tests the basic functionality of the MCP server
./test-mcp-basic.sh
```

### **Fragment-Specific Benchmarks**

This script allows you to run performance tests on specific fragments to measure their individual performance.

-   `test-fragments-benchmark.sh`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run benchmarks on all fragments with 100 iterations each
./test-fragments-benchmark.sh --fragment all --iterations 100

# Run a benchmark specifically on the 'zygote' fragment
./test-fragments-benchmark.sh --fragment zygote
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How it Works

Phantom Fragment avoids the overhead of traditional virtualization and containerization by using a set of specialized, high-performance components called "fragments."

### **Fragment Architecture**

Instead of a monolithic daemon, Phantom Fragment is composed of independent yet cooperative fragments, each optimized for a specific task.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Performance Fragments"
        ZY[Zygote Spawner<br/>‚Äì <100ms startup]
        IO[I/O Fast Path<br/>‚Äì io_uring + CAS]
        MEM[Memory Discipline<br/>‚Äì Zero churn]
    end

    subgraph "Security Fragments"
        SEC[Line Rate Security<br/>‚Äì BPF-LSM]
        NET[Network Minimalist<br/>‚Äì eBPF/XDP]
        POL[Policy DSL<br/>‚Äì AOT compiled]
    end

    subgraph "Orchestration Fragments"
        ORCH[Graph Orchestrator<br/>‚Äì PSI/NUMA aware]
        MODE[Adaptive Modes<br/>‚Äì Direct/Sandbox/Hardened]
        FRAG[Fragment Store<br/>‚Äì CAS + deltas]
    end

    ZY --> ORCH
    IO --> ORCH
    MEM --> ORCH
    SEC --> POL
    NET --> POL
    POL --> MODE
    ORCH --> MODE
    MODE --> FRAG
```

**Key Advantages over Docker:**

-   **Zygote Spawning**: We use pre-warmed process templates (`clone3()`) instead of starting a new container from scratch every time. This is a primary reason for our sub-100ms startup times.
-   **Direct Rootfs**: We use a simple, direct filesystem layout, avoiding the performance penalty of Docker's layered filesystem (like overlay2).
-   **Kernel-Native Integration**: We leverage advanced Linux kernel features like BPF, seccomp, and io_uring directly for maximum performance and security.
-   **Self-Contained Binary**: The entire system is distributed as a single, ~50MB binary with an embedded Alpine Linux rootfs, making it portable and easy to deploy.

## üîí Security-by-Design

Security is not an afterthought in Phantom Fragment; it is a core design principle with zero performance overhead.

### **Isolation Technologies**

We use a multi-layered security approach to isolate sandboxed environments:

-   **User Namespaces**: Ensures that processes inside the sandbox run as unprivileged users on the host system.
-   **Seccomp Profiles**: We use strict system call filtering to restrict what a sandboxed process can do. Profiles are tailored for each language (e.g., Python, Node.js) to minimize the attack surface.
-   **Capabilities Control**: We drop all unnecessary Linux capabilities, following the principle of least privilege.
-   **Read-only Filesystem**: The base rootfs is immutable, preventing any modification of the core environment.
-   **Network Isolation**: Network access is disabled by default and can be enabled with strict eBPF/XDP-based rules.
-   **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and disk usage are constrained using cgroups.

### **Security Profiles**

Phantom Fragment comes with pre-configured security profiles for common use cases. You can see the full list by running `./bin/phantom profile list`.

| Profile | Language | Network | Filesystem | Use Case |
|---------|----------|---------|------------|-----------|
| `python-dev` | Python | Limited | Restricted | Secure Python development |
| `node-dev` | Node.js | Limited | Restricted | Secure JavaScript/Node development |
| `strict` | Any | Disabled | Read-only | For maximum security applications |

## üéØ Use Cases

-   **AI Agent Development**: Provide a safe and fast execution environment for code generated by LLMs.
-   **Educational Environments**: Allow students to run code in a secure, isolated sandbox.
-   **CI/CD Integration**: Run build and test jobs in clean, fast, and disposable environments.
-   **Malware Analysis**: Safely analyze suspicious code without risking system integrity.

## üîß Building from Source

If you want to build Phantom Fragment from source, you will need Go 1.21+ and Git.

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd phantom-fragment

# Build all components with performance optimizations
# The -ldflags="-s -w" strips debug information, making the binary smaller
# The -tags="netgo,osusergo,static" creates a statically linked binary
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -tags="netgo,osusergo,static" -o bin/phantom ./cmd/phantom
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -tags="netgo,osusergo,static" -o bin/phantom-mcp ./cmd/phantom-mcp
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -tags="netgo,osusergo,static" -o bin/phantom-supervisor ./cmd/phantom-supervisor
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can customize Phantom Fragment's behavior through a `config.yaml` file or environment variables.

### **Profile Configuration Example**

Here is an example of how to define a custom profile in your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
profiles:
  my-custom-profile:
    name: "my-custom-profile"
    driver: "bwrap"  # The execution driver to use (Bubblewrap on Linux)
    cpu: "1"         # CPU core limit
    memory: "512m"   # Memory limit
    network:
      enabled: false # Disable network access for this profile
    mounts:
      - source: "./workspace" # Mount the local './workspace' directory...
        target: "/workspace"  # ...to '/workspace' inside the sandbox
        mode: "rw"            # with read-write permissions
```

### **Environment Variables**

```bash
# Set the path to your configuration file
export PHANTOM_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/your/config.yaml

# Set the default security profile to use
export PHANTOM_DEFAULT_PROFILE=my-custom-profile

# Enable verbose debug logging
export PHANTOM_DEBUG=true
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **"Command Not Found" Errors**

-   **Error Message**: `bash: ./bin/phantom: No such file or directory` or `The term '.\bin\phantom.exe' is not recognized...`
-   **Cause**: You are likely in the wrong directory.
-   **Solution**: Make sure you have navigated into the `phantom-fragment` project directory before running any commands.

### **Go Module Errors**

-   **Error Message**: `go: go.mod file not found in current directory`
-   **Cause**: You are trying to run a `go build` command from outside the project directory.
-   **Solution**: Navigate to the `phantom-fragment` directory where the `go.mod` file is located.

### **Permission Errors on Windows**

-   **Error Message**: `...cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.`
-   **Cause**: PowerShell's execution policy is preventing the test scripts from running.
-   **Solution**: You can bypass the policy for a single command by running PowerShell as an administrator or using the `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` flag:
    ```powershell
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\test-phantom-performance.ps1
    ```

### **Getting Help from the CLI**

If you need more information about a command, you can use the `--help` flag.

```bash
# Get help for the main command
./bin/phantom --help

# Get help for a specific subcommand, like 'run'
./bin/phantom run --help

# Get help for the MCP server
./bin/phantom-mcp --help
```
